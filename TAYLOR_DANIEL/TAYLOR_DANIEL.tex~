\section{Description of my branch-and-bound implementation}
I created the necessary classes for b-n-b, then set about filling in the abstract classes. Most work occurs in RamblersState, as RamblersSearch only really needed accessor methods to get important bits of imformation. I created accessors for coordinates (coords) and the localCost that would be necessary
GoalPredicate():
\begin{itemize}
    \item Takes searcher, finds the goal it is looking for. If this doesn't match the current coordinates, it returns false, otherwise true
\end{itemize}
GetSuccessors():
\begin{itemize}
	\item Probably the most extensive method in this class
	\item gets the x and y of the current 
	\item Then finds all surrounding nodes and adds them to an ArrayList of nodes that are in bounds
	\item for every node in the surrounding nodes, calculate the cost of moving to it from the current node
	\item Add that as a state to successors, and then return that
\end{itemize}
sameState():
\begin{itemize}
	\item Checks if the coordinates are the same, if they are, returns true
\end{itemize}
	
These are the major functions that were implemented, after that, all that came down to it was running some coordinates through it in RunRamblersBB.java


\section{Description of my A* implementation}
I created the necessary for A* implementation then filled out the abstract classes. The A* classes work very similarly to branch and bound, especially given that the given classes dealt with a lot of the 'legwork' of the A* implementation. As such, all that was really necessary to change was the estimated cost and heuristics. I created a separate method for those called getRemCost():
\begin{itemize}
    \item Takes the searcher currently being used and coordinates
    \item It has multiple methods in it, which can be selected to produce the estimated g() value (from the equation of h(n) = g(n) + f(n))
    \item it then returns the estimated remCost
\end{itemize}
